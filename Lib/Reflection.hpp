//M(pair<A,B>)
//as an instantiation of  macro M with two arguments --
//pair<A is first and B> second.

 * Declare type returned by an iterator
 *
 * To be used inside a public block of a class declaration

 *
 * Although the macro formally takes variable number of arguments, it
 * should be used only with a single argument. The variable number
 * of formal arguments is to allow for the use of template types,
 * such as pair<int,int>, since the preprocessor considers every
 * comma as an argument separator.
